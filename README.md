### Report on completed work.

The work took 3 days. Many points weren't observed during the layout and adding interactivity to the elements. However, these conditions are met and I work exactly from the idea.

**The task was completed. This stack includes:**

* HTML
* SCSS
* JS
* ReactJS
* Bootstrap (React-Bootstrap)

**It is worth noting that all functional requirements were met exactly to the end:**

- [x] All buttons should be fully functional and trigger the expected actions or events.
- [x] Ensure that the user interface replicates the provided design concept accurately.
